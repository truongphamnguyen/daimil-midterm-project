## **Overview**
OkCupid is a U.S.-based, international operating online dating, friendship, and formerly also a social networking website and application. It was launched in January 19th, 2004 by a group a developers from Harvard University. It is currently owned by Match Group which also owns Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of Fish and many other popular dating apps and sites. OkCupid is considered to be a dating platform designed to be less centered on physical appearance. 
## **The Data Set**
This dataset was created with the use of a python script that pulled the data from public profiles on www.okcupid.com. It compromised of 59946 user profiles, which includes people within a 25 mile radius of San Francisco. 

The dataset categorize user profiles with 31 different columns: 
    - 21 of which is user's natural consistent attribute of a person such as age, sex, education, ethnicity etc.
    - 

Due to Github upload file size restriction, the dataset is not included in this repository but it can be downloaded at [`okcupid_profiles.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/captainqq/dating-profiles-analysis-and-visualization/data). After downloading, be sure to save it in the `data` folder.


## **Cleaning the data**
1. Process null value
    - 
2. Check for dupliated row
    - found none 
3. Combined possible similar data without compromised the data integrity, to reduce number of labeling
    - crunching/generalize the `education` column
    - ~~crunching/generalize the `ethnicity` column~~ 
        - (it is challenging to generalize people with mixed races, so I've withdrawed from this task)
