      "hey there! hope your evening is off to a great start. you did land on my profile, so it can't be that bad right? haha jk.  i was born in new york city and moved to san francisco in 2010 to chase my dream of one day becoming a ceo at a fortune 500 company. unfortunately, i haven't had time to get out much b/c of work. i'm hoping to meet a sweet girl who will show me her favorite parts of the city and where i can get the best sf eats.  so what do i like to do in my free time? well, i'm a people person and love hanging out with my friends and meeting new people. i like sports and working out. i often play pickup games of basketball, and love hitting tennis balls. i used to play ice hockey quite a bit, but haven't really found a team to join in sf yet. i also like to play piano and read, mostly non-fiction and business related stuff. my favorite tv channels are food network and travel channel. my most recent trips out of the country were to china and hong kong, and paris, brussels and amsterdam.  what do i look for in a girl? the most important thing to me is her values. humility, passion, intelligence, and empathy are some of the things i find most attractive. i would also like to meet someone who is not afraid to live her life, have fun, take chances, and is not insane. if you have a playful sense of humor, a pretty smile, and live a healthy lifestyle you'd be someone who i want to get to know.  if you think we'd get along, i'd love to hear from you. send me a message and i'll try my best to get back to you soon. if not, i wish you a wonderful evening shopping online for your perfect guy.     1\n",

      "is it odd that having a little \"enemy\" status with someone, makes them seem more interesting to me?  i'm an extremely socially-graced outcast. my totally awkward childhood surprisingly yielded to something extroverted, thoughtful and diplomatic. i'm a nice guy, i love people, i love humanity, and i can get pretty angry about all of the above. if i end up the loudest guy in the room, i'm never so loud that i cant hear what anyone else is saying.  though i am often inappropriate and desperately unable to pass up a joke, no one has ever punched me. i think too much, and talk to much, but know when to shut the f up.  for the sake of accurate representation, i'm going to qualify my \"average\" body type as a bit of muscle and a bit of fat. note: i have recently become an ebook-reading-cardio-addict. now that i can jog and read oversized print at the same time i can't stay away from a treadmill. seriously, 4+ books, 60+ minutes 4+ times a week for 6 weeks and counting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
