      "ok, i'm not 44, i'm 48. but i feel the need to adjust this detail in order to meet women who might have more in common with me... having said this, i'm a very young 48 (that sounds dumb i know). but, i live a life that is far too youthful to pigeonhole myself at some specific age. so, i'm not trying to trick anyone in regards to my age...i'm just trying to meet a compatible match and if this is what it takes, so be it...i generally do not fib about myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "i have a fantastic life filled with friends and family. i have a successful career that i'm passionate about and i am my own boss. all things considered, life is good. now, i'm looking to share it with a partner...  i enjoy road trip adventures and getaways to sunny locales. vacation wise, i am not good with an itinerary. i prefer a low key vacation and can spend time by the pool or ocean without an ounce of guilt. i also prefer the experience to the picture so i have more stories than proof but i'm ok with that.  i love most sports and can watch almost any event on tv or live. don't worry if you don't like sports. i won't try to convert you and i'm not a fanatic. there can be harmony!  i have a fantastic group of diverse friends and family and i am looking for someone who isn't thrown off by that. i am also open to meeting new people and have space for someone in my life.  all pics are current and accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
      "hey there! hope your evening is off to a great start. you did land on my profile, so it can't be that bad right? haha jk.  i was born in new york city and moved to san francisco in 2010 to chase my dream of one day becoming a ceo at a fortune 500 company. unfortunately, i haven't had time to get out much b/c of work. i'm hoping to meet a sweet girl who will show me her favorite parts of the city and where i can get the best sf eats.  so what do i like to do in my free time? well, i'm a people person and love hanging out with my friends and meeting new people. i like sports and working out. i often play pickup games of basketball, and love hitting tennis balls. i used to play ice hockey quite a bit, but haven't really found a team to join in sf yet. i also like to play piano and read, mostly non-fiction and business related stuff. my favorite tv channels are food network and travel channel. my most recent trips out of the country were to china and hong kong, and paris, brussels and amsterdam.  what do i look for in a girl? the most important thing to me is her values. humility, passion, intelligence, and empathy are some of the things i find most attractive. i would also like to meet someone who is not afraid to live her life, have fun, take chances, and is not insane. if you have a playful sense of humor, a pretty smile, and live a healthy lifestyle you'd be someone who i want to get to know.  if you think we'd get along, i'd love to hear from you. send me a message and i'll try my best to get back to you soon. if not, i wish you a wonderful evening shopping online for your perfect guy.     1\n",

      "is it odd that having a little \"enemy\" status with someone, makes them seem more interesting to me?  i'm an extremely socially-graced outcast. my totally awkward childhood surprisingly yielded to something extroverted, thoughtful and diplomatic. i'm a nice guy, i love people, i love humanity, and i can get pretty angry about all of the above. if i end up the loudest guy in the room, i'm never so loud that i cant hear what anyone else is saying.  though i am often inappropriate and desperately unable to pass up a joke, no one has ever punched me. i think too much, and talk to much, but know when to shut the f up.  for the sake of accurate representation, i'm going to qualify my \"average\" body type as a bit of muscle and a bit of fat. note: i have recently become an ebook-reading-cardio-addict. now that i can jog and read oversized print at the same time i can't stay away from a treadmill. seriously, 4+ books, 60+ minutes 4+ times a week for 6 weeks and counting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "\"about me:  i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.  about you:  you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span.\""
